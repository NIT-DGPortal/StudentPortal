**Open source is a shared perspective. Everyone is welcomed to contribute but without rules, things get really messy. Hence it is very essential that you read through these and try to follow them as you move along.**

*****
Step 1. Getting an issue assigned
*****
* You can start either by opening a new issue or getting yourself assigned an existing one (which is currently not assigned to anyone else).
* In either case, you need to understand what you want to do and how you want to implement it
* In case you opening a new issue, do not forget to follow the `new-issue-guideline <https://github.com/monsij/StudentPortal/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE>`_ before opening one.
* To check issue assignments visit `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jSrhFM0GeirtDerIcN43KCEDOR8bpHjWLx4beuq4Tk/edit?usp=sharing>`_ . If you found out an unassigned issue comment under the appropriate issue and **mention the maintainers**. One of the maintainers will assign it and will label the issue. Kindly bear with this as there were some unavoidable circumstances leading to this. But surely, this won't hamper the overall process.

*****
Step 2. Opening a Pull Request
*****
* Before you open your PR, make sure your PR contains all the applicable points as of `this template <https://github.com/monsij/StudentPortal/blob/master/pull_request_template.md>`_ .
* Additionally, mention the issue number in the PR comment as **Issue: #7**.
* After you have done so, wait for a maintainer to review and get it merged.

*****
Review Process
*****
* If everything seems great, one of the maintainers will acknowledge the commit by::

    ack commit-SHA
* Else you'll be seeing something like this::

    unack commit-SHA
  You might need to change something as per the exact requirement.
